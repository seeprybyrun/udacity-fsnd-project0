The project consists of the following files:

entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py (provided for the project by Udacity)
media.py

To run the project, make sure all files are in the same directory. Navigate to 
that directory in the terminal. Then enter and run the command
> python entertainment_center.py 

A website fresh_tomatoes.html will be generated and will open automatically in
a web browser. The top 25 movies from IMDB will be displayed in the browser. You 
can click on each movie to play a trailer of the movie from YouTube.
